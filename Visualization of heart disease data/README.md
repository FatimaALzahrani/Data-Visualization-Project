## About_Dataset
### Context
##### This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

## Visualization
 ### Stacked_Column_Chart
##### This chart can be used to show the distribution of heart disease cases based on the different types of chest pain (cp). Each column represents a specific chest pain type, and the height of the column represents the count or percentage of cases for that particular type. we add a (sex) as legend to differentiate between males and females where  green represent females and purple for male.

 ### Scatter_Plot
 ##### A scatterogram can be used to analyze the relationship between resting blood pressure (trestbps) and cholesterol levels (chole) in individuals with and without heart disease. The x-axis represents trestbps, the y-axis represents chole, and the dots can be colored based on the presence or absence of heart disease (target column), with green indicating peoples with heart disease and purple indicating peoples without. This visualization helps to identify any potential associations between these variables.

### Line_Chart
##### We create a line chart to track the variation of resting blood pressure (trestbps) over different age groups (age). Each line represents a specific age group, and the x-axis represents age while the y-axis represents resting blood pressure.
