## About_Dataset
### Context
##### This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

## Visualization
### Stacked_Column_Chart
##### This chart can be used to show the distribution of heart disease cases based on the different types of chest pain (cp). Each column represents a specific chest pain type, and the height of the column represents the count or percentage of cases for that particular type. we add a (sex) as legend to differentiate between males and females where  green represent females and purple for male.

 ### Scatter_Plot
 ##### A scatterogram can be used to analyze the relationship between resting blood pressure (trestbps) and cholesterol levels (chole) in individuals with and without heart disease. The x-axis represents trestbps, the y-axis represents chole, and the dots can be colored based on the presence or absence of heart disease (target column), with green indicating peoples with heart disease and purple indicating peoples without. This visualization helps to identify any potential associations between these variables.

### Line_Chart
##### We create a line chart to track the variation of resting blood pressure (trestbps) over different age groups (age). Each line represents a specific age group, and the x-axis represents age while the y-axis represents resting blood pressure.

### Stacked_Column_Chart
##### Use a stacked column chart to visualize the frequency of heart disease cases based on age groups. The x-axis will represent age ranges (e.g., 20-40, 40-60,60-80), and the y-axis will show the count of individuals. Each column will be stacked, with one segment representing individuals without heart diseas "purple" and the other segment representing individuals with heart disease "green".

### Pie_Chart
##### a pie chart to display the distribution of different chest pain types (cp). Each slice of the pie will represent a chest pain type, and the size of each slice will be proportional to its occurrence frequency.

### Pie_Chart
##### A pie chart can be used to represent the proportion of individuals with fasting blood sugar (fbs) greater than 120 mg/dl among those with heart disease. we group the data based on fbs values (0 or 1), and the chart will show the percentage or count for each category.

### table
###### A simple table visualization can display all the columns in a tabular format. Each row represents an individual, and the columns display the corresponding values for age, sex, cp, trestbps, chole, fbs, restecg, thalach, exang, oldpeak, slope, ca, thal, and target. You can sort and filter the table based on different columns to analyze the data more effectively.

### Silcer
###### To facilitate the filtering of all visual images by resting blood pressure "trestbps" and maximum heart rate "thal", and knowing the effect of these two factors on the incidence of heart disease.

### Matrix
##### A matrix visualization allows we to summarize the data based on multiple dimensions. We use the target column as the value and chol column as the row and slope column as the column , to show the distribution of heart disease cases. This provides a comprehensive view of how serum cholestoral and the slope of the peak exercise ST segment contribute to heart disease incidence.

### Cards
#####  we use individual cards to display key summary statistics related to heart disease. For example, we can create cards to show the total count of individuals, individuals with heart diesease, the average age, individuals with sugar  and  count of individuals suffer from exercise induced angina. This allows us to highlight important metrics at a glance.

### Summary
#### These charts help us visualize and analyze the relationships between various factors and heart disease incidence. By examining these relationships, we can identify potential risk factors, patterns, and correlations, which can inform medical professionals, researchers, and policymakers in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of heart disease.
